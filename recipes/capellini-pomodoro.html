                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water.</li>
                        <li>Score a shallow "x" in the bottom of the tomatoes. 
                            <br>Add tomatoes to the boiling water and cook uncovered until skin starts to peel off, about 1 minute. 
                            <br>Drain in a colander and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. 
                            Peel tomatoes. <br>Transfer peeled tomatoes to a food mill, and process until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                            <br>Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. 
                            <br>Drain, saving 1/4 cup of the pasta water for the sauce.</li>
                        <li>While pasta cooks, melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. 
                            <br>Add garlic and salt and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                            <br>Add pureed tomatoes and as much pasta water as desired. Simmer until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                            <br>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li> 
                        <li>Divide pasta amongst 4 serving bowls. 
                            <br>Top with tomato sauce, parmesan cheese and sprinkle with fresh basil. 
                            <br>Serve immediately.</li>    
                    </ol>
