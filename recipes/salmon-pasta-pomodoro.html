                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. 
                            <br>Once the water is boiling, stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. 
                            <br>Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, 
                            but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. <br>Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water. 
                            <br>Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
                        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                            Place onion and garlic in the skillet in an even layer then lay salmon fillets on top. 
                            <br>Place a lid on the skillet and cook the salmon until it flakes easily and the onions are tender. 
                            <br>Flake all of the salmon. Season with salt and pepper, then reduce the heat to medium. 
                            <br>Toss the spaghetti, tomatoes, and basil with the salmon and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. 
                            <br>Stir in some of the pasta water if the pasta becomes dry.</li>
                    </ol>
